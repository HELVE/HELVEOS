# HELVE OS | Personal Organization Micro webOS

**HELVE OS** is a website/server-based personal organization microOS (POMOS Master Shell). Habit Automation System with multiple programs working in unison. 

Its purpose is to track, maintain and analyse behavioral productivity of the user while establishing creative project databases available for public and private access alike.

It contains *shells* that act as system functionalities.

Shells
----------
Layers of "ozone software". Develop the term ozone software.

# BRIEF/SHELL - Helve OS Voice Bot Assistant System

**Brief** *brfshell*

Shell Placement: helve.live/#brief

**Brief's** fundamental part is the *Habit Automation System*. It enhances speed of communication, task management and assignment, note-taking, scheduling, overview analysis of current project progress and status etc. **Brief** HAB is based on the principles of [Project Dopamine Trails](https://github.com/HELVE/DOPAMINETRAILS), which helps clarify your core drives, maximizes focus and minimizes friction in getting things done through rewiring the notion of dopamine triggers and using them productively.

Moment-establishing voice bot assistant with visuals containing Habit Automation System. Voice assistant for all organization and data purposes. Streamlines the day schedule with no need to check the screens. Contains a variety of subprograms designed to carry the data load for you so you can focus on what matters.

## Habit Automation System

### System Structure

System structure is based on [Project Dopamine Trails](https://github.com/HELVE/DOPAMINETRAILS). 

Helve Directive Protocols (Dopamine Optimization Framework) contain Operations (overarching effort loops), Operations contain Programs (specific types of routines that establish habits in certain life aspects over time), Programs contain Modules (narrative structures that help address specific sections of certain Programs).

Protocols_ (Top Abstract) >

Modules_ (Base Abstract)

- PSY_OPS - psychological operations.
- CON_OPS - control operations.
- PHY_OPS - physical operations (?)  <- merge this one with psychological since it's just as much external.

### Routine Ideas

- Computer activate Helve AVR workspace (teal clr) [SITUATION CONTEXT]
- Computer activate Hitech Crime workspace (red clr) [SITUATION CONTEXT]
- Computer activate Kannibal workspace (white clr) [SITUATION CONTEXT]
- Computer define our core values
- Computer define our core drive (to visually hack the world)
- Computer activate introduction (guest protocol)
- Computer list service offers
- Computer list active ops
- Computer what's the current number of projects in database
- Computer define our directive protocols
- Computer, current Operative list
- Computer give me the brand uptime
- Computer initiate/activate lockdown
- Reminder: Hydration Required (every 3 hours)
- Reminder: Activate Lockdown Procedures (at the end of the day)
- Reminder: Nutrition? 2 times a day
- ACTIVE Reminder: Set up GitHub commit 2 times a day
- Computer, quick mantra: Please repeat after me. I am  patience. I am compassion. I am wisdom. I am love. I am selfless. Everything that I'm experiencing right now will pass eventually. I am powerful and I deserve every power-filled thing in the universe. Remember that not all the things are directly about you. Often people reflect themselves upon you.
