# HELVE OS | Personal Organization MicroOS (Web?)

**HELVE OS** is a website/server-based personal organization microOS (POMOS Master Shell). Habit Automation System with multiple programs working in unison. 

Its purpose is to track, maintain and analyse behavioral productivity of the user while establishing creative project databases available for public and private access alike.

It contains *shells* that act as system functionalities.

# SHELLS [BASE OZONE LAYER]
Layers of "ozone software". Develop the term ozone software. Or relate it to the "handle of a weapon" metaphor.

# BRIEF/SHELL - Helve OS Voice Bot Assistant System [SUBOZONE LAYER]

**Brief** *brfshell*

Shell Placement: helve.live/#brief

**Brief's** fundamental part is the *Habit Automation System*. It enhances speed of communication, task management and assignment, note-taking, scheduling, overview analysis of current project progress and status etc. **Brief** HAB is based on the principles of [Project Dopamine Trails](https://github.com/HELVE/DOPAMINETRAILS), which helps clarify your core drives, maximizes focus and minimizes friction in getting things done through rewiring the notion of dopamine triggers and using them productively.

Moment-establishing voice bot assistant with visuals containing Habit Automation System. Voice assistant for all organization and data purposes. Streamlines the day schedule with no need to check the screens. Contains a variety of subprograms designed to carry the data load for you so you can focus on what matters.

## Habit Automation System (HAS)

### System Structure

System structure is optimized for usage in conjunction with [Project Dopamine Trails](https://github.com/HELVE/DOPAMINETRAILS). 

Helve Directive Protocols (Dopamine Optimization Framework) contain Operations (overarching effort loops), Operations contain Programs (specific types of routines that establish habits in certain life aspects over time), Programs contain Modules (narrative structures that help address specific sections of certain Programs).

- Computer define our core values
- Computer define our core drive (to visually hack the world)
- Computer activate introduction (guest protocol)
- Computer list service offers
- Computer list active ops
- Computer what's the current number of projects in database
- Computer define our directive protocols
- Computer, current Operative list
